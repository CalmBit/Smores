*Smore ores!*

**This mod is open source and under a permissive license.** And as such,
can be included in any modpack on any platform without prior permission.
We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not need
to ask to use them. See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.

Smores provides a basic set of metals, dusts and gems (and their respective common products)
for use in mods and modpacks. This provides a common basis for mods and modpacks to use instead
of adding/generating their own proprietary ores.
