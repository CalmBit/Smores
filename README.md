*Smore ores!*

**This mod is open source and under a permissive license.** And as such,
can be included in any modpack on any platform without prior permission.
We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not need
to ask to use them. See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.

Smores provides a basic set of metals, dusts and gems (and their respective common products)
for use in mods and modpacks. This provides a common basis for mods and modpacks to use instead
of adding/generating their own proprietary ores.

# FAQ

## Q. What about (random ore/metal)?
It's unlikely we'll take direct suggestions, but if you really feel some critical modded material is missing, used
by a majority of mods, make an issue, and we'll consider it.

## Q. This seems like a Substratum ripoff.
This mod is inspired by Substratum, and any other mod like it - we're just trying to
dial in what exactly we want, aesthetically as well as functionally.

## Q. Why should I use this if my favourite mod already adds ores?
This mod attempts to add a baseline set of ores for a variety of mods that (ideally) would rely on one
of these types of mods to generate and utilize their ores, rather than adding an ore per mod. If
a mod (or modpack) already add a multitude of ores, it may defeat the purpose of using this mod
in the first place (however, modpackers may find more flexibility here, as various configurations 
could easily lower the number of ores added by mods, and replace them with this mod).
